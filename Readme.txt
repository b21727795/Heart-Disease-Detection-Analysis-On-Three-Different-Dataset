This study was carried out as the term-project of Hacettepe University Machine Learning course(BBM406).

In this paper we introduce methods for heart disease detection and data sets analysis, 
We experiment with three different data sets. The first dataset includes 303 records and 13 features + binary
target. The second data set includes over 4000 records and 14 features + binary target. The third
data set includes 70.000 records of patients data, 11 features + binary target. We aim to compare
different machine learning algorithms on this data sets and their results. We are going to determine
which algorithm is more suitable for the data sets we use for heart disease detection problem. We
are going to also compare the results we have found for all algorithms with previous studies.
